    Assange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland,[28][29][30] to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951),[31] a visual artist,[32]:34 and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder.[33] The couple separated before their son was
    born.

    When Julian was a year old, his mother married Brett Assange,[34][35][36] an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname).[37] Christine had a house in Nelly Bay on
    
    Magnetic Island, where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.[29] Christine and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult
    
    The Family, and they had a son before breaking up in 1982.[28][38][32]:37–38 Julian had a nomadic childhood, living in over 30[39][40] Australian towns and cities by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother
    in Melbourne. Assange attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979–1983)[37] and Townsville State High School in Queensland[42] as well as being schooled at home.[35] He studied programming, mathematics
    and physics at Central Queensland University (1994)[43] and the University of Melbourne (2003–2006),[34][44] but did not complete a degree.[45] Assange has four children. While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa, and in 1989 they
    had a son, Daniel, who is now a software designer.[34][45][46] The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child.[35] During the time of the custody dispute, Julian's brown hair turned white.[28] Julian was Daniel's primary caregiver
    for much of his childhood. From 2009 to 2012, Assange was in a relationship with British journalist Sarah Harrison.[48] In a 2015 open letter to then-French president François Hollande, he stated that another of his children lives in France
    with the child's mother. He also said his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.[49] In 2020, Assange's fiancée, South African-born lawyer Stella Moris-Smith
    Robertson, announced that the couple have two children together, conceived during the time he resided in Ecuador's London embassy and she was handling his legal interests.[50][51][52] They began a relationship in 2015 and have been engaged since
    2017.

        <h4>Hacking</h4>
        <hr/><br/>
        <pre>
    In 1987, aged 16, Assange began hacking under the name Mendax[35][53] (Latin for "liar"[54]). He and two others—known as "Trax" and "Prime Suspect"—formed a hacking group they called "the International Subversives".[35] He is thought to have been involved
    in the WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers) hack at NASA in 1989, but he does not acknowledge this.[55][32]:42 In September 1991, Assange was discovered hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, a Canadian multinational telecommunications
    corporation.[35] The Australian Federal Police tapped Assange's phone line (he was using a modem), raided his home at the end of October[56] and eventually charged him in 1994 with 31 counts of hacking and related crimes.[35] In December 1996,
    he pleaded guilty to 24 charges (the others were dropped) and was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond.[55][57] The perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent and his disrupted childhood were cited
    to justify his lenient penalty.

        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <hr/><br/>
        <pre>
    Assange, c. 2006 In 1993, Assange gave technical advice to the Victoria Police Child Exploitation Unit that assisted in prosecutions.[61][62] In the same year, he was involved in starting one of the first public Internet service providers in Australia,
    Suburbia Public Access Network. He began programming in 1994, authoring or co-authoring the TCP port scanner Strobe (1995),[64][65] patches to the open-source database PostgreSQL (1996),[66][67] the Usenet caching software NNTPCache (1996),[68]
    the Rubberhose deniable encryption system (1997)[69][70] (which reflected his growing interest in cryptography),[71] and Surfraw, a command-line interface for web-based search engines (2000).[72] During this period, he also moderated the AUCRYPTO
    forum,[71] ran Best of Security, a website "giving advice on computer security" that had 5,000 subscribers in 1996,[32]:45 and contributed research to Suelette Dreyfus's Underground (1997), a book about Australian hackers, including the International
    Subversives.
    
    In 1998, he co-founded the company Earthmen Technology.[60] Assange stated that he registered the domain leaks.org in 1999, but "didn't do anything with it".[60] He did publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency
    in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: "This patent should worry people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived in the bowels of an unaccountable foreign spy agency."

        <h4>Founding WikiLeaks</h4>
        <hr/><br/>
        <pre>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a> (/ˈwɪkiliːks/) is an international non-profit organisation that publishes news leaks[5] and classified media provided by anonymous sources.[6] Its website, initiated in 2006 in Iceland
    by the organisation Sunshine Press,[7] claimed in 2015 to have released online 10 million documents in its first 10 years.[8] Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder and director.[9] Since September
    2018, Kristinn Hrafnsson has served as its editor-in-chief.

    Assange at the "New Media Days 09" in Copenhagen November 2009 Assange and others established WikiLeaks in 2006. Assange became a member of the organisation's advisory board[74] and described himself as the editor-in-chief.[75] From 2007 to 2010, Assange
    travelled continuously on WikiLeaks business, visiting Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.[35][40][76][77][78] WikiLeaks published internet censorship lists, leaks,[79] and classified media from anonymous sources, including revelations about
    drone strikes in Yemen, corruption across the Arab world,[80] extrajudicial executions by Kenyan police,[81] 2008 Tibetan unrest in China,[82] the "Petrogate" oil scandal in Peru.[83] Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg at the 26C3 in Berlin, December
    2009 WikiLeaks first came to international prominence in 2008,[84] when "most of the US fourth estate" filed an amicus curiae brief—through the organisational efforts of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)—to defend Wikileaks
    against a DMCA request from the Swiss bank Julius Baer, which had initially been granted.[85] In September 2008, during the 2008 United States presidential election campaigns, the contents of a Yahoo! account belonging to Sarah Palin (the running
    mate of Republican presidential nominee John McCain) were posted on WikiLeaks after being hacked into by members of Anonymous.[86] After briefly appearing on a blog, the membership list of the far-right British National Party was posted to WikiLeaks
    on 18 November 2008.[87] In 2009, WikiLeaks released a report disclosing a "serious nuclear accident" at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility.[88] According to media reports, the accident may have been the direct result of a cyberattack at Iran's
    nuclear program, carried out with the Stuxnet computer worm, a cyberweapon built jointly by the United States and Israel.[89] Later documents included leaked emails from the Turkish government published at the height of Erdoğan's post-coup purges
    in Turkey in December 2016,[90][91] and the collection of more than two million emails from Syrian political figures, government ministries and companies. Assange said of the Syria Files that "it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another,
    but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it."[92] In June 2015, Wikileaks began publishing confidential and secret Saudi Arabian government documents.[93]
    By 2015, WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses, and was described by Assange as "a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents".

        <h4>Iraq and Afghan War logs and US diplomatic cables</h4>
        <hr/><br/>
        <pre>
    The material WikiLeaks published between 2006 and 2009 attracted various degrees of international attention,[95] but after it began publishing documents supplied by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley), WikiLeaks became
    a household name. The Manning material included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010)[4] which showed United States soldiers fatally shooting 18 people from a helicopter in Iraq, including journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh.[5]
    
    This material also included the Afghanistan War logs (July 2010),[96] the Iraq War logs (October 2010),[97] and the Guantánamo files (April 2011).[98] Controversy surrounding WikiLeaks reached its greatest intensity after Assange published a quarter
    of a million U.S. diplomatic cables,[99] known as the "Cablegate" files, in November 2010, initially working with established Western media organisations, and later with smaller regional media organisations, while also publishing the cables upon
    which their reporting was based.[100][101] The files showed United States espionage against United Nations and other world leaders,[102][103][104] revealed tensions between the U.S. and its allies, and exposed corruption in countries throughout
    the world as documented by U.S. diplomats, helping to spark the Arab Spring.[105][106] The Cablegate and Iraq and Afghan War releases impacted diplomacy and public opinion globally, with responses varying by region.[101] Opinions of Assange at
    this time were divided. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard described his activities as "illegal",[107] but the police said he had not broken Australian law.[108] United States Vice-President Joe Biden and others called him a "terrorist".[109][110][111][112][113]
    
    Some called for his assassination or execution.[114][115][116][117][118] Support for Assange came from Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,[119] Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa,[120] Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,[121][122] British
    Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn (then a backbench MP),[123] Spanish Podemos party leader Pablo Iglesias,[124] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay,[125] and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro.[126] He also garnered
    support from many leading activists and celebrities, including Tariq Ali,[127] John Perry Barlow,[128] Daniel Ellsberg,[129][130] Mary Kostakidis,[131] John Pilger,[132][133] Ai Weiwei,[134] Michael Moore,[135] Noam Chomsky,[134] Vaughan Smith,[136][137]
    and Oliver Stone.[138] Gun camera footage of the airstrike of 12 July 2007 in Baghdad, showing the deaths of journalists Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh by a US helicopter The year 2010 culminated with the Sam Adams Award, which Assange accepted
    in October, and a string of distinctions in December—the Le Monde readers' choice award for person of the year,[140][141] the Time readers' choice award for person of the year (he was also a runner-up in Time's overall person of the year
    award), a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3 million,[144][145][146] and selection by the Italian edition of Rolling Stone as "rockstar of the year". In February 2011, he won the Sydney Peace Foundation Gold Medal for Peace
    with Justice, previously awarded to only three people—Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, and Buddhist spiritual leader Daisaku Ikeda.[148] Two weeks later, he filed for the trademark "Julian Assange" in Europe, which was to be used for "Public speaking
    services; news reporter services; journalism; publication of texts other than publicity texts; education services; entertainment services."[149][150][151] Assange is a long standing member of the Australian journalists' union, of which he was
    made an honorary member in 2010.[152][153][154] He was awarded the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in June 2011,[155][156] having earlier won the Amnesty International UK Media Award (New Media) in 2009.[157] In 2011, the Walkley Foundation
    awarded WikiLeaks the Walkley Award for "Most outstanding contribution to journalism".[158] It commended WikiLeaks and Assange for their "brave, determined and independent stand for freedom of speech and transparency that has empowered people
    all over the world". Cypherpunks was published in November 2012.[159] In 2012, Assange hosted a television show called the World Tomorrow on RT, a network funded by the Russian government.

        <h4>US criminal investigation</h4>
        <hr/><br/>
        <pre>
    Assange speaks on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral in London, 16 October 2011 After WikiLeaks released the Manning material, United States authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange personally to prosecute them under the Espionage Act of 1917.[161]
    
    In November 2010, US Attorney-General Eric Holder said there was "an active, ongoing criminal investigation" into WikiLeaks.[162] It emerged from legal documents leaked over the ensuing months that Assange and others were being investigated by
    a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia.[163] In December 2011, prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and an alleged WikiLeaks interlocutor they claimed to be Assange;[164][165] he denied
    this,[166][167][168] dismissing the alleged connection as "absolute nonsense".[169] The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June–July 2013.[170] The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer
    a password, but the evidence that the interlocutor was Assange was circumstantial, and Manning insisted she acted alone.[171] In 2013, US officials said that it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified
    documents because "it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organisations and writers who published classified material, including The Washington Post and Britain's Guardian newspaper".[172] Assange was being examined
    separately by "several government agencies" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI.[173] Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was under "active and ongoing" investigation at that time.[174] Moreover, some Snowden
    documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the "2010 Manhunting Timeline",[175] and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.[176] In
    the same documents, there was a proposal by the National Security Agency (NSA) to designate WikiLeaks as a "malicious foreign actor", thus increasing the surveillance against it.[175] In January 2015, WikiLeaks issued a statement saying that three
    members of the organisation had received notice from Google that Google had complied with a federal warrant by a US District Court to turn over their emails and metadata on 5 April 2012.[177] In July 2015, Assange called himself a "wanted journalist"
    in Le Monde, in an open letter to the French president.[49] In a December 2015 court submission, the US government confirmed its "sensitive, ongoing law enforcement proceeding into the Wikileaks matter".[178] Under the Obama Administration, the
    Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it was unable to find any evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist.[179] However, after Trump took power, CIA director Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped
    up pursuit of Assange, rejecting the Obama-era view.[180] In April 2017, US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange.[181] In early 2019, individuals began to come forward with news of being questioned about Assange by prosecutors
    in Alexandria, Virginia. Legal scholar Stephen Vladeck stated that the prosecutors, after refusing to unseal the indictment, accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks.[182] Witnesses named
    in the investigation included Jacob Appelbaum, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, David House, Jason Katz and Chelsea Manning, all of whom condemned it as a form of government over-reach.

        <h4>Swedish sexual assault allegations</h4>
        <hr/><br/>
        <pre>
    Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assange_v_Swedish_Prosecution_Authority">Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority</a> Demonstration in support of Assange in front of Sydney Town Hall, 10 December 2010 Assange visited Sweden
    in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women.[8] He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was reopened
    by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of "lesser-degree rape" (Swedish: mindre grov våldtäkt). Assange denied the allegations and
    said he was happy to face questions in Britain.[9][184] On 20 November 2010, the Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol for Assange. On 8 December 2010, Assange gave himself up to British police and attended his first
    extradition hearing where he was remanded in custody pending another hearing. On 16 December 2010, at the second hearing, he was granted bail by the High Court and released after his supporters paid £240,000 in cash and sureties. A further hearing
    on 24 February 2011 ruled that Assange should be extradited to Sweden. This decision was upheld by the High Court on 2 November and by the Supreme Court on 30 May the next year.[185] After previously stating that she could not question a suspect
    by video link or in the Swedish embassy, prosecutor Marianne Ny wrote to the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2013. Her letter advised that she intended to lift the detention order and withdraw the European arrest warrant as the actions
    were not proportionate to the costs and seriousness of the crime. In response, the CPS tried to dissuade Ny from doing so.[186] In March 2015, after public criticism from other Swedish law practitioners, Ny changed her mind about interrogating
    
    Assange, who had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[187] These interviews, which began on 14 November 2016, involved the police, Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian officials, and were eventually published online.[188] By that time,
    the statute of limitations had expired on all three of the less serious allegations. Since the Swedish prosecutor had not interviewed Assange by 18 August 2015, the questioning pertained only to the open investigation of "lesser degree rape",
    whose statute of limitations is due to expire in 2020.[189][190][191][192] On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities suspended their investigation against Assange, claiming they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with
    Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020. "We are not making any pronouncement about guilt",
    she said.[193][194][195] Following Assange's arrest on 11 April 2019, the case was reopened under prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson. In September 2019, she revealed that she had interviewed seven witnesses, two of whom had not been previously heard,
    but had yet to determine how to proceed in the case.[196] On 19 November, she announced that she had discontinued her investigation into Assange, stating that after a comprehensive assessment, "the evidence is not strong enough to form the basis
    for filing an indictment". She added that although she was confident in the complainant, "the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed". Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson welcomed the decision
