            Assange was born Julian Paul Hawkins on 3 July 1971 in Townsville, Queensland,[28][29][30] to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951),[31] a visual artist,[32]:34 and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder.[33] The couple separated before their son was
            born.[33]
            <br /> When Julian was a year old, his mother married Brett Assange,[34][35][36] an actor with whom she ran a small theatre company and whom Julian regards as his father (choosing Assange as his surname).[37] Christine had a house in Nelly
            Bay on Magnetic Island, where they lived from time to time until it was destroyed by fire.[29]
            <br /> Christine and Brett Assange divorced about 1979. Christine then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, and they had a son before breaking up in 1982.[28][38][32]:37–38
            Julian had a nomadic childhood, living in over 30[39][40] Australian towns and cities by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne.[34][41]
            <br /> Assange attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979–1983)[37] and Townsville State High School in Queensland[42] as well as being schooled at home.[35] He studied programming, mathematics and
            physics at Central Queensland University (1994)[43] and the University of Melbourne (2003–2006),[34][44] but did not complete a degree.[45]
            <br /> Assange has four children. While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa, and in 1989 they had a son, Daniel, who is now a software designer.[34][45][46] The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child.[35]
            During the time of the custody dispute, Julian's brown hair turned white.[28] Julian was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood.[47]
            <br /> From 2009 to 2012, Assange was in a relationship with British journalist Sarah Harrison.[48] In a 2015 open letter to then-French president François Hollande, he stated that another of his children lives in France with the child's mother.
            He also said his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.[49] In 2020, Assange's fiancée, South African-born lawyer Stella Moris-Smith Robertson, announced
            that the couple have two children together, conceived during the time he resided in Ecuador's London embassy and she was handling his legal interests.[50][51][52] They began a relationship in 2015 and have been engaged since 2017.
